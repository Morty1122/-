# Digital signal encoding

Completion of BER curve comparison of Hamming, cyclic and convolutional codes through AWGN channel, Rayleigh channel and Rice channel, respectively, and completion of three different comparison methods

①BER curves of the same coding method through different channels

②BER curves of different coding methods through the same channel

③BER curves of different types of convolutional codes through Rayleigh channel as an example
